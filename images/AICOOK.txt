AICook

The idea is that the cameras can scan what’s inside and let users know what items they’re short on, 
even making meal suggestions based on the ingredients they still have.
So in short, we take an exiting frigde and add software upgrades to enable 
AI image recognition in its View Inside cameras.

Improved meal planning with the help of Akaani.
Akaani lets users plan meals for up to a week and then creates smart shopping lists using ingredients that 
apply to multiple recipes.

2 very important points
It identifies ingredients in the frigde and offer up recipe and meal plan suggestions based on what 
ingredients you have.
